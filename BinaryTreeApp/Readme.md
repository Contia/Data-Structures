# Binary Tree in C++ 

## Overview
In this project, we implemented a binary tree in c++ with one restristion. Each node must have at most two childean (left and right
node). Each new node is randomly placed in the binary tree. Our purpose is to show how could you implement a dynamic data structure with the use of linked lists and c++ pointers. There are two only methods that you should use:
- insert(): adds an integer to the binary tree
- startTraverse(): traverses the binary tree. We only implemented the inorder traverse.
